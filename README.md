yttext is chrome extension that extracts the text from a YouTube video frame.

When learning something on YouTube the transcript of whats on the screen could be really useful.
There could be an important list in the video you want to keep.
It can be annoying to manually copy so I made this chrome extension.

This was also the first time I used TypeScript in a project. 
It was a great experience and I plan on making the jump to using TypeScript for everything soon
(was a little annoyed by event types though haha).

Its not necessarily perfect, here are some bugs I plan to iron out:
<ul>
<li>Sometimes it doesnâ€™t work on videos with ads.</li>
</ul>

If you'd like to try it out:
<ul>
  <li>Download this repo</li>
  <li>On Google Chrome go to settings > extension</li>
  <li>Turn on Developer Mode (right corner toggle) </li>
  <li>Click load unpacked then choose the build folder in the frontend </li>
  <li>You'd also need to start the api (cd into the backend folder then do npm start) </li>
</ul>
